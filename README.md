# Smart-Recycling

## About 

Our app called "Smart Recycling" aims at improving the sorting of recyclables from non-recyclables using image recognition. 

When a user scans an object, the app returns a feedback to the user about the appropriate bin for that item.

Recycling has never been easy, and not everyone has been taught how to recycle. 

That's how our app comes in handy. Not only does it teach the users how to recycle, but it has a point system, encouraging them to keep recycling and compete with their friends.
