# Smart-Recycling

## About 

Our web-app called "Smart Recycling System" aims at improving the sorting of recyclables from non-recyclables using image recognition, which can reduce contamination and increasing recycling rates. This system will provide immediate feedback to users, educating them on proper recycling practices and contributing to long-term behavioral change.
