# Smart-Recycling

## About 

Our app called "Smart Recycling" aims at improving the sorting of recyclables from non-recyclables using image recognition. 

When a user scans an object, the app returns a feedback to the user about the appropriate bin for that item.

Recycling has never been easy, and not everyone has been taught how to recycle. 

That's how our app comes in handy. Not only does it teach the users how to recycle, but it has a point system, encouraging them to keep recycling and compete with their friends.

## Running the app

To run the app, first make sure you're in the "code" tab on github. Then click on the "code" button in blue, and go to the local tab and click on "download zip". 

After downloading the zip, extract all and open the folder in any IDE of your choice, but I recommend VSC. 

Once in VSC, go to "file" tab and click on "open", and select the folder you extracted from the zipped one you downloaded. 

After that, you might need to run these commands, 1 at a time, in order: 

```
npm i bootstrap@5.3.3
```

```
npm i bootstrap-icons
```

As we're using Bootstrap5, a CSS framework, you might not be able to see the used components unless you run the above 2 commands. 

After that, you go to "extensions", and write "open with live server" in the search bar, and install the first extension. 

After that, go back to the main page of VSC where you see all your files, and right-click on "Login.html", and click on "Open with Live Server". 

Now, you're able to see our website on your browser! ENJOY :)
